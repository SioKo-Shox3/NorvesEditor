// Stop-hook mirror guard for Codex-main sessions (NorvesEditor working
// agreement): CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md must stay byte-identical (Claude reads
// one, Codex reads the other).
//
// Why Stop and not PostToolUse (the Claude-side design): probed live on
// codex-cli 0.142.5 (2026-07-07) — PostToolUse does NOT fire for
// `apply_patch`, so an after-edit check is impossible there. Checking at
// turn end instead is MORE robust: it catches drift regardless of how the
// edit happened (apply_patch or Bash).
//
// Semantics: on Stop, if <cwd>/CLAUDE.md and <cwd>/AGENTS.md both exist and
// differ, exit 2 with fix instructions — Codex is forced to continue and
// mirror before finishing the turn. ONE nudge per turn: when
// stop_hook_active is set (this continuation was already forced by a stop
// hook) we exit 0 — a stop-hook feedback loop once wrecked a session (see
// failure taxonomy), and the fix is a single cp, so one nudge is enough.
// Fails OPEN on any internal error.
