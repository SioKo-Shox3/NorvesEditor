// physically block main-thread implementation patches.
//
// Output channel: plain text on stdout. (Claude Code's
// hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext JSON is Claude-specific — verify the
// Codex injection path with `codex exec` before trusting changes here; see
// Docs/agent-guide/codex-delegation.md.)
// Fails open (exit 0, no output) on any error.

// Mode signal: CODEX_MODE=ultra (set by ~/.agent-workflow/codex-ultra.ps1)
// switches to the fleet-mode policy text. Editing THIS file does not break
// hook trust — trusted_hash covers hooks.json only. Sessions launched from
// Codex Desktop do not receive the env signal and get the standard text;
// both texts are compatible with autonomous delegation by design.

  "- CHILDREN carry only 3 rules: stay inside assigned paths; run the verification commands (build/test) and return real output; stop after 2 failures of the same approach and return evidence to the parent. Children never write declarations, never run check-scope, never call ask-advisor.",
  "- EXIT, once, on the INTEGRATED diff: check-scope.mjs against the kickoff globs; minimality + WHY-comment pass/fail items (review-lenses.md); heavy-artillery only on load-bearing phases. Completion report keeps the 2 mandatory sections (hotspots by risk / needs-human-judgment).",

LIGHT (<=2 files, ~<=50 changed lines, no load-bearing area, no public API/schema/ownership change): go STRAIGHT to one implementer with conventions+verification embedded in the brief, run the gates, commit — the cross-AI second review MAY BE SKIPPED (state 'light path' in the report). STANDARD: full workflow, but the cross-AI second review runs ONCE on the task's integrated diff, not per phase. HEAVY (load-bearing/public API/data formats/concurrency): all gates + heavy-artillery. When the user asks for speed, default to LIGHT and say so — do not gold-plate.",
  "- Implementation is delegated to subagents: spawn_agent -> .codex/agents (implementer etc.) with the approved plan, allowed write paths, and conventions. A PreToolUse guard BLOCKS main-thread apply_patch on implementation source — do not try to type code directly.",

Do NOT wrap the call in a shell-tool timeout — the wrapper cuts only on failure evidence, never on elapsed time. If Claude is unavailable (limit/refused), run a second independent Codex review and REPORT the skipped gate.",
