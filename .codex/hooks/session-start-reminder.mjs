  "- Every non-trivial change gets a DOUBLE review: Codex-side first review (impl-reviewer agent, never the author) + a MANDATORY second review by the non-main AI (Claude): `claude -p \"<review brief>\" --model opus --permission-mode plan` (interactive session only — sandboxed codex exec has no network for claude -p; approve out-of-sandbox execution). If unavailable, run a second independent Codex review and REPORT the skipped gate.",

  "- Discipline skills (installed in ~/.codex/skills): invoke $fable-reasoning before any non-trivial phase (recon -> evidence hierarchy -> decomposition -> stop conditions), and $phase-gates before the first file edit of a phase AND before reporting anything as done. Mention them by name — skills do not carry across turns.",
  "- Stop conditions: after 2 failures of the same approach, change method or consult the non-main AI — never loop. Escalate after 2x refute/rework.",
