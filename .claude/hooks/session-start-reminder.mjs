// Emits the reminder as additionalContext. Fails open (exit 0, no context) on

  "NorvesEditor workflow policy (ENFORCED by hooks, not just CLAUDE.md):",
  "- The main session is the ORCHESTRATOR: it splits phases, decides, integrates, and reviews — it does not write implementation itself.",
  "- DEV-STAGE DIAL (2026-07-13): check the 開発段階 line in CLAUDE.md. In EXPLORATION stage (pre-alpha), the LIGHT path is the DEFAULT for everything outside danger zones; cross-AI review and plan/test-design stages run ONLY for danger-zone work; quality debt is repaid in BATCH (code-gardening + one integrated review) at milestones, not per task. Speed beats per-task QA at this stage — user policy.",
  "- TRIAGE FIRST (cost guard, 2026-07-12): classify the task before starting and declare the path. LIGHT (<=2 files, ~<=50 changed lines, no load-bearing area, no public API/schema/ownership change): go STRAIGHT to one implementer with conventions+verification embedded in the brief, run the gates, commit — the cross-AI second review MAY BE SKIPPED (state 'light path' in the report). STANDARD: full workflow, but the cross-AI second review runs ONCE on the task's integrated diff, not per phase. HEAVY (load-bearing/public API/data formats/concurrency): all gates + heavy-artillery. When the user asks for speed, default to LIGHT and say so — do not gold-plate.",
  "- Implementation is delegated to the `implementer` subagent (top model for load-bearing areas; include the no-loop clause: stop after 2 failures of one approach). Do NOT hand implementation to the partner AI's CLI — cross-CLI implementation handoff is abolished (2026-07-12); the partner AI only does second reviews and consultations. The main thread plans, integrates, and reviews; it never types code.",
  "- A PreToolUse guard BLOCKS main-thread Edit/Write of implementation source (.rs/.ts/.tsx/.js/.cpp/.h). Do NOT try to type code directly — hand it to the implementer subagent.",
  "- STANDARD/HEAVY changes get a DOUBLE review: top-model Claude first review (plan-reviewer / impl-reviewer, never the author) + an independent Codex second review via DIRECT CLI, ONCE per task on the integrated diff: `codex exec --sandbox read-only ...` (synchronous; do NOT wrap in a shell-tool timeout — cut only on failure evidence, never on elapsed time). NEVER via plugin (`codex:rescue`). If the CLI call fails, fall back to impl-reviewer + verifier and REPORT the skipped gate. CONVERGENCE: max 2 review rounds — reviewers classify findings blocking/non-blocking, only blocking requires fixes, round 2 verifies ONLY the fix-diff (new findings accepted only if blocking). There is NO round 3: leftovers are logged as 残課題 and routed to the repayment cycle. Never loop review↔fix.",
  "- Quality roles (planner, plan-reviewer, impl-reviewer, verifier) run on the top model; research/mechanical work runs cheap. Escalate on high-risk areas (protocol, Tauri permissions, async lifecycle, C++ SDK API).",
  "- Before any non-trivial phase, invoke the `fable-reasoning` skill (recon -> evidence -> decomposition -> stop conditions). Before the first file edit of a phase AND before reporting anything as done, invoke the `phase-gates` skill (request/entry/exit gates). They encode the top-model discipline this workflow assumes.",
  "- Consult triggers are CONCRETE (workflow-core/consult-triggers.md) and ORCHESTRATOR-ONLY: same-signature failure twice, third fix for one symptom, guard block + rewording urge, 2x declared budget, out-of-declaration changes. Window: node ~/.agent-workflow/ask-advisor.mjs <claude|codex> (arg REQUIRED; convention: pick the NON-main AI). The 5-line phase declaration (falsifier + ```scope block) is written by the orchestrator, per phase; check-scope.mjs verifies ONCE against the integrated diff. Subagents never write declarations, never run check-scope, never call ask-advisor.",
